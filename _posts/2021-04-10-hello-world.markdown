Hello hello !

The very first post on this lovely Saturday morning in Stockholm, Sweden. 

![](/assets/img/blog/2021_04_10_stockholm.jpg)


First off, i have been feeling to start writing for a long time. Everytime i start, i get tangled in choosing a hosting solution to PHP Scripting in Wordpress and never get around the part to actually writing. So this time, i "tried to" keep it simple and host the blog in github pages with Jekyll ( Ruby Gems ).

I have tried blogs in the past but never went for long than a year. I hope this time it stays strong.

I do not have specific topics in mind but i will be mostly writing about my interests and explorations in both technology and life.

So if you are one of those intriguied by the same things that i do, then welcome to my tiny little space in the world wide web.

**Disclaimer :** All the writings/opinions here are my own.
